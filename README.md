I was annoyed by the fact that Bootstrap, by default, includes Glyphicons.

I don't know about you, but I only use Font Awesome.
This is Bootswatch's themes for Bootstrap 3, all with Glyphicons replaced with
Font Awesome.

Never again will you have to embed both. Never again will your site's visitors are
forced to download unused Glyphicons.

The file with "neue" in the filename are the same, but with Comic Neue font.
I plan for the next release to drop the Google Fonts dependency.
